# My DevOps Learning Journey

## 1. Overview of My Learning
I began exploring DevOps as part of my coursework and personal projects. Over time, I have gained a foundational understanding of various tools and practices that are critical in modern DevOps workflows. While Iâ€™m not an expert, I have successfully applied several tools and technologies in small projects to gain hands-on experience.

## 2. Tools and Technologies I've Learned
### 2.1. Core Tools
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing applications to ensure consistent deployments across environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Managed containerized applications and used Ingress controllers for routing traffic.
- **GitHub Actions**: Implemented CI/CD pipelines for a web application.
- **Terraform**: Learned to define and manage EKS clusters.
- **Jenkins**: Built CI/CD pipelines for Kubernetes deployments.
- **Kyverno**: Experimented with policy enforcement in Kubernetes.
- **Knative**: Learned about serverless workloads in Kubernetes.
- **Service Mesh**: Gained a basic understanding of Istio and traffic management.

### 2.2. Concepts and Practices
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Defined and managed infrastructure using Terraform.
- **Cloud Native Tools**: Worked with AWS services like EKS to deploy Kubernetes clusters.

## 3. My Contributions
### 3.1. Blog Writing on Kubernetes
I have written blogs explaining Kubernetes concepts in simple terms, including:
- Setting up Kubernetes clusters.
- Using Ingress for traffic routing.
- Integrating Kyverno for policy enforcement.

### 3.1. Blog Writing on Github Actions
GitHub Actions has been a crucial tool for learning CI/CD. I explored:
- Writing workflows for automated builds and testing.
- Using secrets and environment variables in workflows.
- Automating deployments to Docker Hub and Kubernetes.

### 3.2. GitHub Actions for CI/CD
I implemented CI/CD pipelines for a basic web application using GitHub Actions. This included:
- Setting up workflows to build and test the code on each push.
- Automating deployment to a Docker container.

### 3.3. Experimenting with EKS and Terraform
I set up an EKS cluster using Terraform, learning how to define infrastructure as code. This helped me understand:
- Cluster provisioning.
- Managing Kubernetes workloads on AWS.

## 4. Challenges and Learnings
While learning these tools, I faced challenges such as:
- Debugging complex Kubernetes configurations.
- Understanding Terraform syntax and AWS integrations.
- Setting up service meshes and traffic rules.

However, overcoming these challenges taught me the value of systematic problem-solving and collaboration.

## 5. Future Goals
### 5.1. Technical Skills
- Deepen my knowledge of Kubernetes, especially in advanced topics like Helm and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).
- Learn more about observability tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack.
- Gain expertise in service meshes like Istio and Linkerd.
